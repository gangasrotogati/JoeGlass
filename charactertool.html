				<p id = "raceDescription" class = "description">Humans are a prolific race which the Gods seemingly have made as a joke. They have invented several competing languages, making communication between themselves impossible outside their own lands. Their bite can cause sepsis, they excrete an explosive gas and they fight each other based on the colour of their hides. In between waging war on each other because they can, they work together furiously to build for themselves, often creating structures that are excessively large. They exist on an unbalanced diet of fats, sugars and substances they know to be toxic to themselves. They lack the dexterity to scratch their own backs and cannot even contort to be able to reach most of it with their tongue. Humans have deep emotional attachments to many ideals such as honour, duty and nobility. These tend to push humans further forward than most races would expect them to, where someone may give up in a hopeless situation a human will blindly continue the path because someone of a higher station ordered it to. Their mass numbers and luck have propelled them to be the dominate race. When the sciences and arts flourished, they simultaneously promoted and suppressed it.</p>
